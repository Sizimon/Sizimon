# Hi, I’m Szymon 👋  

I’m a **self-taught junior+ developer** with a passion for **learning, building, and solving problems**. My journey into programming started from an early love of technology — I built my first gaming PC when I was 11, and ever since I’ve been fascinated by how things work under the hood.

## 🚀 Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript / TypeScript  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Databases & Tools:** PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS

## 🛠️ Projects I’ve Worked On  

- **Discord Community Management Bot**  
  A bot designed for gaming communities that handles party-making, attendance tracking, and role-based features — built to scale across multiple servers.  

- **Note Tracking App**  
  A productivity-focused notepad with rich text editing, task filtering, and tagging features, designed for developers who want structure without clutter.  

- **Weather App**  
  A simple yet meaningful milestone — my very first non-tutorial project. It consumes a weather API and displays live weather data in a clean, minimal interface.  

- **🎥 Upcoming: Clip Timestamping Tool**  
  Currently in development — a tool that allows users to paste a video link, add **timestamped notes**, and export them into a clean, organized format. Perfect for studying, content creators, or anyone who needs structured note-taking for videos.

## 🎮 About Me  
Outside of coding, you’ll usually find me:  
- Playing video games (always hunting for the next great co-op experience 🎧)  
- Sitting in my IDE building new ideas 💻  
- Skiing when the snow hits the mountains 🎿
